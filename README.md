# endysi

Endysi (ENsemble DYnamics SImulator) is a program for creating, 
simulating, and analysing models of competetive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
networks.  It was developed to facilitate my PhD research in this area. 
At the moment, it is restricted to this type of network only, but does 
allow one to create networks of any size with fixed connectivity.  (In
general, a ceRNA network is a bipartite network composed of M miRNA 
nodes, N ceRNA nodes, each connected by K edges.)  The models generated 
here are based on those published by 
[Ala et al., 2013](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/18/7154.full) and 
[Nitzan et al., 2014](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495%2814%2900342-7) .

This project is primarily for personal use; it is published here to 
allow for easy deployment of the latest changes to various machines 
used for research.  As such, there are a few things to mention to anyone 
trying to run it. 

* First, Endysi WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS! I run Linux on all my machines,
and didn't bother with Windows support.  It SHOULD run on any *nix based
system (e.g., OSX or *BSD), but I've only ever run it on Linux-based 
systems.

* Endysi uses BioNetGen (www.bionetgen.org) on the backend.  It expects
the downloaded BioNetGen distribution to be in ~/apps/BioNetGen. No 
doubt I should change this, but hey, so far I'm the only one using this
thing.  BioNetGen itself depends on Perl, but should be installed by
default on any Linux distro.

* Python dependencies: 
    0. Written in Python 2.7, but I have run it in Python 3 (just for kicks).
    1. matplotlib
    2. scipy
    3. numpy
    4. pexpect
    5. networkx

* I personally keep my development/deployment environment separate from 
the system environment using pyenv and plenv for Python and Perl, 
respectively. This is not a requirement; it simply allows me to maintain 
control over the running environment without messing with system 
libraries. 

### Installing and running

1. To install, simply clone the repo wherever you want and make sure you 
have the above dependencies installed.  

2. cd into the directory above and run:
`python2 endysi.py --help`
This will tell you about the command line arguments.  For example:
`python2 endysi.py -m 5 -n 10 -k 2 -s 100 --method ode`
will create an ensemble of 100 networks consisting of 5 miRNAs and 10 
ceRNAs in which each miRNA targets 2 ceRNAs and each ceRNA targeted by 
2 miRNAs; these networks will then be simulated as systems of ODEs.  
The other option for `--method` is 'ssa' (i.e., a Gillespie simulation). 
The networks generated are random MNK models.  All kinetic rate constants 
are selected at random from physiologically plausible ranges.  

3. When it runs, the above command will create a new directory for the 
raw data and results in ~/research/results/ceRNA/endysi.  This is ongoing
and as yet unpublished research, so I'm reluctant to say too much about
the details.  (Which is to say, please don't scoop me!)

### Future plans

I'll be expanding the code to include more details in the future:
translation of mRNAs into proteins; loading of miRNAs into Ago1 and 
formation of the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex); transcriptional 
regulation via transcription factors, possibly including explicit 
modelling of RNA polymerase.  

Another future idea involves moving toward thermodynamic modelling and 
representing the RNAs as actual sequences of nucleotides, which makes 
the rate parameters more realistic.  Network topology is another concern: 
so far, the generated models are random networks, but real-life ceRNA 
networks are scale-free small worlds (as are most biochemical networks). 
Thus, it makes sense to use scale-free models here as well.  

I'd also like to add alternative simulation backends, as well as 
alternative modelling frameworks (gene-product Boolean networks, Petri 
nets, membrane computing models, etc.)
